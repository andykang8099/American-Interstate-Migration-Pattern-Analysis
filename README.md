# American-Interstate-Migration-Pattern-Analysis

This is my Economics thesis research project, American Interstate Migration Pattern Analysis, under the supervision of Prof. Wiswall during the Spring 2020 semester.

This project could be categorized by the following four main parts:

1.Clean and wranglen the  ACS individual migration pattern data from 2008 to 2018 and extracted 10+ related migration
features (unemployment rates, crime rates, housing affordability, etc.) with cross-sectional time series data in R and Python

2.Apply the Cross-Validation to choose the best performing model from 5+ regression models and determined the statistical
significance of determinants on the out-migration rate and individual migration probabilities using the Logistic framework

3.Analyzed the migration trend over time and predicted the out-migration rates in the following 10 years using autoregressive
(AR) model

4.Visualized the migration rates versus demographic features and different migration patterns across states using Tableau and
R(Shiny)
