# American-Interstate-Migration-Pattern-Analysis

This is my Economic thesis project regarding the American Interstate Migration Pattern Analysis 

This projects could be categorized by the following four main steps:

1.Cleaned and wrangled ACS data about individual migration pattern from 2008 to 2018 and extracted 10+ related migration
features (unemployment rate, crime rate, etc.) using R from cross-sectional time series data

2.Applied the Cross-Validation to choose the best model from 5+ regression models and determined the statistical
significance of determinants on the out-migration rate and individual migration probabilities

3.Analyzed the migration trend over time and predicted the out-migration rates in the following years using autoregressive
(AR) model

4.Visualized the migration rates versus demographic features and different migration patterns across states using Tableau and
R(Shiny)
